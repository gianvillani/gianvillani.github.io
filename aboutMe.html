                <p>I was born in Naples, Florida on August 15, 1998. Shortly after I was born, my family and I moved back up to New York
                    where my parents are from. Only after a few years in New York, my parents decided to make a permanent move back to Florida where I would spend the 
                    majority of my early life. I went to elementary, middle school, and high school all in Naples. I did not have a plan for college at the time
                    because I knew that I wanted to join the military. So when I was only 17, I joined the Marines and was headed for boot camp.
                    Boot camp taught me a lot about myself and how determination can get you through a lot. It was a tough 3 months but I graduated and moved on to
                    additional training after boot camp, then my Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) school. I was trained to be a Heavy Equipment Operator (1345) and I
                    learned to operate all sorts of interesting and cool pieces of machinery all made for copious amounts of varying tasks. My 4 years in the Marines
                    taught me a great deal and made lifelong friends, but it was time to move on with my life. So when my active duty contract was up, I returned home.

                <p>Right before leaving the military I completed a training known as "Skill Bridge". This training is dedicated to teaching military personnel
                    with a trade skill so that they could find a job much easier when they left. I was training to be a lineman, where I would work on electrical poles and transformers.
                    I completed this training right as Covid had began and would find it hard to find work in the field. When I returned home to Florida, I searched for
                    work right away but would always be rejected because of my lack of experience. I did however find a job with a company called Always On Generators being a 
                    piping apprentice and learning all about the gas systems required for emergency generators. It was a good job that taught me a lot but it was not for me.
                    I then decided to hold myself to a higher standard and decided to enroll into college courses and utilize my G.I. Bill at a local state college called Florida SouthWestern State College.
                    I started my college journey there in the Spring of 2021, where I was re-introduced to the world of academics.

                <p>My first degree that I was going for at FSW was in computer programming. I knew I wanted to do something with computers because that is what I find most interesting. 
                    After a couple semesters, I knew that I wanted to get my bachelor’s but the program I was in did not satisfy the general education required for a bachelor’s degree. 
                    So I switched majors to be able to get all of my general studies done, and in the process pick a school where I could finish my bachelor’s. 
                    I had one meeting with my advisor and he had shown me about UCF and the great programs they have here. As soon as I saw that I was dead set to enroll here. 
                    When the time was near from graduating FSW I applied to UCF and was accepted for the Fall term of 2022. 
                    I graduated from FSW and immediately moved to Orlando to begin the second half of my academic journey. There have been no breaks since the spring semester start of 2021 and 
                    I am finally in my last semester here at UCF in 2025. It has been a long and tiring journey, but I am more than ready to move on to a new chapter in my life.
