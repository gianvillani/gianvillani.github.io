                <img src="Java%20GUI%20Project.png" alt="Factory 25 Image Logo">
                <p>This Java GUI was a class project that required us to make a "Amazon" like store that interacted
                    with a CSV file and added items to a cart. In this project, the user was allowed to add and remove items
                    from their cart and completely reset their whole order. This project taught me a lot on how powerful java can be sometimes. It was my first time using Java for a GUI
                    but was a fun experience. Here is a list of what I learned while making this, and below will be a button to see the program in action.

                <p>KnightsRide is a web application that is currently in development. Its purpose is to possible give students another way to be able to get to campus
                    without using the shuttle system or public bus transportation. Down below is button to check out our team's proposal but here are some skills I learned already while
                    starting this project.
